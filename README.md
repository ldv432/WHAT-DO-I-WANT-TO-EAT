# **What Do I Want to Eat? 🍽️🤔**  

We've all been there. Whether it's just you, you and your significant other, or a whole group of friends, deciding where to eat can be a struggle.  

It usually takes **40 minutes of indecisiveness** before someone finally takes charge—probably dragging everyone to that **amazing hot pot place** down the road.  

But what if there was a **better way**? A **streamlined approach** where you just answer a few simple questions and have a decision made in **minutes**?  

That's where **"WHAT DO I WANT TO EAT"** comes in.  

This project is **born out of necessity** for those of us who are **chronically indecisive** when it comes to food choices. 🍕🍣🍔

## **✨ How Does It Work? 👨🏾‍💻**  
1. **Select Your Food Style** – Choose the type of food you’re craving (e.g., Italian, Sushi, BBQ).  
2. **Set Your Distance** – Adjust a **slider** to define how far you're willing to drive.  
3. **Pick Your Budget** – Enter how much you're willing to spend, **either per person or as a group**.  
4. **Get Recommendations!** – The app will use **your location** to suggest nearby restaurants that fit your criteria.  

🔹 **Note:** The app **requires location access** to find restaurants near you, so make sure you **accept the location prompt** when asked!
